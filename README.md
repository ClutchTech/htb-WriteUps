# Hackthebox Write Ups

The purpose of this repo is to learn and house the writeups for completed machines and challeneges from hackthebox.eu.
Each challenge or machine has its own directory.
In each directory, there will be a README.md that is meant to be the writeup.
There may also be additional directories specific to the machine.
These could be for altered payloads or exploits.
